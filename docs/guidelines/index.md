title: Guidelines - Introduction

The AspirePress guidelines are just that - guidelines.

They are not rules, they are not policies, they are not enforceable and they are not set in stone.

They are intended to guide our implementation of the project in the best way possible through general consensus, but
they do not provide a set of hard-and-fast rules that inform every decision we have to make. Some situations won't be
covered by guidelines; other situations may call for a specific disregard of the guidelines entirely.

These guidelines do form the basis for how we conduct ourselves, and unless there's a good reason for ignoring them,
they should otherwise be honored as much as possible.
