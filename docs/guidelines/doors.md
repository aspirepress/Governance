## Two-Way Doors

Some decisions are two-way doors. That means that you can walk in, and you can easily walk out again. These kind of
decisions are possible to reverse, and generally take little or minimal effort to do so. 

Examples of two-way doors are discussions around which web server to use: Nginx, Apache, etc. In reality, this doesn't
matter since switching this technology is relatively simple in the overall scheme of things. This is a two-way door.

## One-Way Doors

A one-way door is a decision that is difficult to reverse. This is a situation where when you walk through the door,
the door is closed behind you and you can't easily open it or go back through it the other way. An example would be
selecting the framework that the application runs on.

One-way doors should be discussed and debated and consensus reached in order to ensure we reach the best decision we
can with the information we have.

## How to apply this guideline

Two-way door questions should be decided on a "best answer at the time" or a "competition of ideas". This means that
if there is disagreement on a particular way forward, the team should spend a small amount of time discussing it, or
even implement a POC of both solutions and then decide quickly which one to adopt based on their knowledge and
experience.

For two-way door questions, the person who is successful in their approach should never gloat and the person who is not
successful should never take it personally. No decision made in a two-way door scenario is irreversible. If a person
who does not win their preferred solution feels later on that their solution might address a problem faced by the team,
they should raise it again politely. The team should reconsider. While the decision may not be changed, the discussion
is important.

One-way door questions are an opportunity for discussion and a time-out. If a decision is effectively irreversible, or
changing it is so difficult that it's essentially irreversible, the team needs to be certain that it's the best decision
they can make *at the time*.

## Passionate debate, polite disagreement

When discussing a two-way door or one-way door issue, it's important to remember two this: first, a passionate defense
of one's ideas is perfectly acceptable, but also, we must disagree politely.

Debate the *merits* of a solution, not the *qualities* of the person proposing it. Don't engage in ad hominem or other
types of personal attacks. 

Where possible, reach consensus. When consensus is not possible, it is the responsibility of the team lead to make a
final decision. Once a final decision is reached the team should embrace it, and move forward with it.
