## What is AspirePress?

AspirePress is an open source project dedicated to improving the WordPress ecosystem for all developers.

We're building the content management system we all aspire for.

## Governance Documentation

This site contains three sections:

1. **Core Principles** - An outline of the core principles of the AspirePress project that guide our decision-making,
   but do not carry the weight of official policy.
2. **Guidelines** - These are guidelines that adopt from our core principles but don't rise to the level of official
   policies. They are essentially a written version of our culture, and reflect how we do things, but are meant to be
   bent or broken on occasion and are not meant to cover every scenario.
3. **Policies** - These are official policies of the AspirePress organization, which outline things that *must be
   followed* as a matter of course. Breaking these policies can be grounds for discipline or removal from the project.

**In general** our goal is to have more guidelines and core principles than actual policies. A policy exists where no
alternative was available. We implement policies to resolve conflicts or issues that cannot be resolved through less
restrictive means. Policies carry the force of official rules in this project, while guidelines and core principles are
signposts that guide our behavior and decision-making without fully constricting it.

## Code of Conduct

AspirePress also implements a [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/aspirepress/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md),
adherence to which is required by all members of the project.
